    "In machine learning, it's useful to use some math to model processes that are probabilistic, or stochastic, or non-deterministic. Computers, on the other hand, generally do not do well with non-determinism, so we simulate sequences of random events with _pseudo-random number generators_ (PRNGs) - functions that to an outside observer, return sequences of numbers that appear as if they are random. PRNGs can be used to simulate sequences of numbers that appear to follow specific statistical distributions. The [`numpy.random`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html) and [`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) packages implement several PRNGs that allow us to simulate sampling from different distributions. \n",
